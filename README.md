# Responsive Price Panel

The price panel is responsive on desktop and mobile screens. At a desktop view, it’s centered horizontally in a column format; when it’s resized down to a mobile screen, the panel will adapt to a smaller viewport and appear vertically with a row layout.

## ✨ Motivation 

I coded from scratch on the CSS file to reinforce my CSS and Flexbox knowledge and practiced building a responsive website with media query. The project starter looks like this:

## 👏 Credits

This project is based on the Flexbox tutorial in <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">The Web Developer Bootcamp</a> by Colt Steele. 

The design is inspired by a CodePen by <a href="https://codepen.io/travisw">Travis Williamson</a>.
